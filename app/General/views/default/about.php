			<h4>Web Developper</h4>

			<p>I'm a 25 years old developper, working somewhere in Europe as a freelance when I'm not travelling.</p>

			<h4>Why Asgard?</h4>
			<p>As a freelance I have always looked for ways to optimize my workflow when building web applications. I have never been totally satisfied with any existing framework. Either incomplete or cumbersome..</p>
			<p>Hence, I started working on my own framework, in 2011. Although it's a lot of work, I got to learn a lot about PHP and I can now relax a bit when developping new projects.</p>
			<p>I have spent countless hours thinking about better ways to do web development with PHP, and I have so far implemented many of my ideas (but not all, yet).</p>
			<p>My objective now is to give Asgard more stability, with more and more tests and a good documentation.</p>
			<p>If you enjoy using Asgard and want to improve it, please submit your requests and issues on github: <a href="http://github.com/asgardphp/">github.com/asgardphp/</a></p>
